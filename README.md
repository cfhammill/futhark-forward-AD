## Simple forward mode AD for Futhark

An implementation of dual number forward mode automatic differentation
cribbed from a [Daniel Brice blog post](http://www.danielbrice.net/blog/automatic-differentiation-is-trivial-in-haskell/) on forward mode AD in haskell. Thanks to @bcdarwin for help
with the implementation.
